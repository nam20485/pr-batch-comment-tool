# Application Icon Placeholder

This directory contains the application icon and other visual assets.

For the actual implementation, an ICO file should be placed here:
- icon.ico (32x32, 48x48, 256x256 sizes)

The icon should represent:
- GitHub integration (Octocat or Git-related imagery)
- Review/commenting functionality
- Professional appearance for desktop application
