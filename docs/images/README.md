# Documentation Images

This directory contains images and screenshots for the documentation.

## Required Images

The following images are referenced in the documentation and should be created:

### README.md
- `app-screenshot.png` - Main application screenshot showing key features

### User Guide
- `authentication-flow.png` - OAuth authentication process
- `repository-selection.png` - Repository browsing interface
- `comment-filtering.png` - Comment filtering and search
- `batch-operations.png` - Batch comment selection and duplication
- `settings-screen.png` - Application settings interface

### Architecture Documentation
- `architecture-diagram.png` - High-level architecture overview
- `data-flow-diagram.png` - Data synchronization flow
- `component-diagram.png` - Component relationships

## Image Guidelines

### Screenshots
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher
- **Format**: PNG with transparency where appropriate
- **Compression**: Optimize for web without losing quality
- **Annotations**: Use consistent styling for callouts and highlights

### Diagrams
- **Style**: Clean, professional appearance
- **Colors**: Use consistent color scheme matching app theme
- **Text**: Readable at different zoom levels
- **Format**: SVG preferred for scalability, PNG as fallback

### Naming Convention
- Use descriptive, kebab-case names
- Include context: `user-guide-repository-selection.png`
- Version with date if needed: `architecture-diagram-2024-01.png`

## Creating Screenshots

### Application Screenshots
1. Use consistent window size and position
2. Show realistic data (avoid Lorem Ipsum)  
3. Highlight key features being documented
4. Use consistent OS theme (preferably Dark mode)

### UI Mockups
- Show ideal state with populated data
- Include various UI states (loading, error, success)
- Demonstrate responsive behavior

## Tools Recommended

### Screenshot Tools
- **Windows**: Snipping Tool, Greenshot, ShareX
- **macOS**: Screenshot utility (Cmd+Shift+4), CleanMyMac Sharpshooter
- **Linux**: GNOME Screenshot, Flameshot, Shutter

### Diagram Tools
- **Draw.io / diagrams.net**: Free online diagramming
- **Lucidchart**: Professional diagramming tool
- **Mermaid**: Text-based diagrams (can be embedded in markdown)
- **Figma**: UI/UX design and prototyping

## Current Status

This directory currently serves as a placeholder. Production documentation should include:

1. **Application Screenshots**: Showing the main interface and key features
2. **Workflow Diagrams**: Illustrating user workflows and processes
3. **Architecture Diagrams**: Technical architecture and component relationships
4. **Installation Screenshots**: Step-by-step installation process
5. **Feature Demonstrations**: Animated GIFs or static images showing features

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding images to this directory:

1. **Optimize file size** while maintaining quality
2. **Use descriptive filenames** that match documentation references
3. **Include alt text** in markdown for accessibility
4. **Version control large files** appropriately (consider Git LFS for very large images)
5. **Test on different devices** to ensure readability
