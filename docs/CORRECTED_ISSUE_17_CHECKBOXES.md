# GitHub PR Review Assistant - Implementation Progress Update (Including PR #16)

## Overview

Create a comprehensive Windows desktop application that streamlines the GitHub pull request review process. The application serves as a productivity tool for developers, enabling efficient navigation through repositories, pull requests, and review comments with advanced filtering, sorting, and batch operation capabilities.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C# with .NET 8.0+
- **UI Framework**: Avalonia UI with MVVM pattern
- **MVVM Framework**: CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- **GitHub API**: Octokit.net
- **Database/Cache**: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
- **HTTP Client**: System.Net.Http (for Gemini API)
- **JSON**: System.Text.Json
- **Logging**: Serilog with structured logging
- **Testing**: xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Architecture

**Repository Pattern with Local Cache (Recommended Option 2)**
- ViewModel ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí (Local SQLite Cache OR Octokit.net ‚Üí GitHub API)
- Benefits: Excellent performance, offline capability, reduced API usage, improved testability
- Local SQLite database caches all GitHub data with intelligent cache invalidation
